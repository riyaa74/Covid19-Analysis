As of 23rd May 2020, India has witnessed 3720 deaths from 32 States and Union Territories, with a total of 123202 confirmed cases due to COVID-19. Globally the Data Scientists are using AI and machine learning to analyze, predict, and take safety measures against COVID-19 in India.

Goal:

We need a explore the COVID situation in India and the world, and strong model that predicts how the virus could spread across India in the next 15 days.

Tasks to be performed:

Analyze the present condition in India

Scrape out the COVID-19 from websites

Figure out the death rate and cure rate per 100 across the affected states

Create different charts to visualize the following:

Age group distribution of affected patients

Total sample test done till date

Growth rate of COVID in top 15 states

Top 10 States in each health facility

State wise testing insight

ICMR testing centres in each state

Use Prophet to predict the confirmed cases in India

Use ARIMA to predict the confirmed cases in India

Compare the Indian COVID cases globall
